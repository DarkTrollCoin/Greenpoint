# Greenpoint District Proposal Vote

Land contributors who staked MANA to Greenpoint in the Decentraland Terraform Event are asked to confirm or deny approval of the [Development Plan]( https://github.com/MovementDAO/Greenpoint/blob/master/Greenpoint-Dev-Plan-v1.0.pdf) proposal. The district development proposal vote is open for 14 days, starting Wednesday 18 April 2018 00:00 AM UTC, ending 2 May 2018 00:00 AM UTC.

The plan will be considered approved when more than 67% of the lands that voted approved it. Votes are accounted for in proportion to the land parcel amount contributed.

>I approve the proposed plan laid out in the Development Plan v1.0 document, and confirm that I have thoroughly read and understood its contents.
